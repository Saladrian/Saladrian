My name is Adrian, I am currently 18 years old and I am from Germany.

I started learning programming when I was 12 years old and I'm actively programming since I'm 15 years old.

Currently I am working with my classmate @danni on a project for Jugend Forscht. Our project is an automated greenhouse with sensors.
